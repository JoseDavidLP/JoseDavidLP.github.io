Growing up I always knew I wanted to be an accountant, but at age 13 I got my very own desktop PC for christmas. Ever since then I have been glued to my desktop computer. I have always been fascinated with the computer and what can be done with it, to be able to access any information at any given time was crazy to me, so I knew that I have always wanted to work with computers in the future. During high school I took a class called AP Computer Science principles. Through this class, I knew that I wanted to learn how to code. Because not only does coding have a great effect on my career it has a positive effect on my life. I find when you think in code you have a better understanding of any problem you will face. And this is why I chose MIS as a major.
