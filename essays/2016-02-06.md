Why I decided MIS!

date: 2022-01-16
 
 Iâ€™ve always enjoyed and respected technology, but it was only when I got my first desktop computer that I started to realize that this is the future. Since I was young I've always known that I wanted to major in Accounting, but at the same time I knew I wanted to work with computers. A bit of researching led me to discover MIS, and knew that it was exactly what I was looking for. So fast forward to today, and here I am continuing on the journey. I look forward to a double major in accounting and MIS because I enjoy the work and I think it can be quite fun.
