Why I decided MIS!

 Iâ€™ve always taken a liking to technology, but it was only when I got my first desktop computer that I started to realize that this is the future. Since I was young I've always known that I wanted to major in Accounting, but at the same time I knew I wanted to work with computers. So, after a bit of researching, I was led to MIS, and knew that it was exactly what I was looking for. So fast forward to today, and here I am continuing on the journey.
